## _Coders be solving complex Problems but struggling to find their Best Match ? Don't Worry! We are here..._

Built Under "Fun and Entertainment Track" for HackNITR 2.0

## âœ” Problem Description

We all know that our Coding geeks might be charming their way in contests with their problem solving skills but when it comes to the emotional skills, not everyone is a pro. But that's not the complete case. There are people who are attracted to Analytically Smart people. So, we have come to the rescue of all such Coding enthusiasts who are confident enough on thier technical skills to get matched with their best partner.

## âœ” Our Solution

The primary identity of the website, i.e., the name is LoveBug. The programmers can solve an infinite number of problems on varying difficulty levels and will help them to easily connect with other people in their nearby locations. The website can track the current location of the users and the algorithm of the website will enable them to connect with the other users who stand in the LeaderBoard of LoveBug platform.

## âœ” How It works :
- Organizers/admin creates a contest from the admin end whih is at https://lovebugadmin.herokuapp.com/
- He enters a start location and an end location 
- He creates multiple intermediate checkoints between the two ( We are using Google APIs for these )
- For each location he enters 3 questions ( easy , medium and hard )
- Now he enters email address for the participants
- The participants are notified at there end that they have been added to a contest ( you can access participant end at : https://lovebugmain.herokuapp.com/ )
- He goes to the actual physical starting point ( yea just like a race , but for techies )
- He solves one question out of 3 , on successfull submission our algorithm gives him a new address ( which is also shown in map at his end ) 
- He then again moves to that address and solves another set of problems ( yea , programming will not leave your hand L ;) )
- When he gets certain number of points by solving questions he gets access to the leaderboard where females who are also close to him geographically are displayed along with there email/phone. At this point he also gets a unique code of length 7
- He contacts one of them and arranges a meeting location
- He shares his code with the partner which informs our end that the match has been done 
- Now organizers can add more fun to this party by actually conducting some events like PROM NIGHTS with the matched pairs
